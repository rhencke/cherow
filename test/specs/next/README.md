## ESNext

Stage 3 proposals that have been implemented into this parser.

Use `{ next: true }` to use this features. **Note** Use them at your own risk! The specs can and will change.

### Supported:

- Asynchronous Iteration
- Import()
- Rest/Spread Properties
- Optional catch binding
- Regular Expression's new DotAll flag

**Note** Async generators are not included in this folder. They are so closely integrated with other tests.
